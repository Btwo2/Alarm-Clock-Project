# Embedded Alarm Clock with C  

In this project it was simulated an Embedded Alarm Clock Algorithm using Isis Proteus and a PIC Programming IDE. The clock has one reset button and two setting buttons, one setting alarm hours by adding 1 and the other setting alarm minutes. When the clock time hits the alarm time a song will be played.
