# Embedded Alarm Clock with C  

This project simulates an Embedded Alarm Clock Device using Isis Proteus and a PIC Programming IDE. The device is composed of a LCD display, a Speaker, a reset button and two setting buttons for alarm hours and minutes. When the clock time hits the alarm time a song will be played through the speaker.
